### Orders

The Orders page contains a grid of all the Orders within the PalletWorks system. Use the dropdowns to filter your view. Filtered views can be bookmarked. Use the Auto-Refresh option to automatically refresh the grid to see live production data as it is created. Bulk Updates are available if at least one Order checkbox is selected. The Pallets button will redirect you to the Pallets page, and auto-filter the Pallets grid to any Pallets associated with the Order you selected the action in. Order Items can be viewed with the same method.
