PalletWorks is designed to be integrated with an Active Directory (or any other OpenId provider). You can use the same credentials to log into the Portal as you use on your local network.

Security is handled by Authelia, which connects directly to an authorization provider.

Certain features are restricted to Administrator access only, set up at the time of installation.
