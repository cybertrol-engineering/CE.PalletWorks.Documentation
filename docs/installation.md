The PalletWorks solution is a highly integrated connection of services and hardware that require professional installation by a Cybertrol technician. There are no self-install options at the time of this documentation.

PalletWorks is designed to be installed on-premises and is hosted in a containerized micro-service architecture.

During installation, a customized `appsettings.json` will be deployed to your installation, setting up all the specific features your production environment requires.
