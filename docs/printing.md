Printing labels is a large component of the PalletWorks product. The PalletWorks solution is designed to be compatible with Bartender 2022 Automation Edition. PalletWorks will support additional printing software once API is available. The Print service included with your PalletWorks installation is configured to handle retrieving printers and labels, and sending print jobs as requested.

The Print Mappings handle directing production workflow through the process of sending the right data to the print provider for label printing. Whenever a print job is sent, it submits all information about the newly created Item or Pallet, and all the information about the Product itself, so that a label contains all the data points required.

Refer to your installation guide for details on your print provider.
